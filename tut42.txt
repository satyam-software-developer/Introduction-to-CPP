Exercise on C++ Inheritance
As we have discussed a lot about inheritance and its types; we have also seen its working with example programs.  In this tutorial, I will give an exercise on C++ inheritance to be solved.

Questions
 You have to create 2 classes:

SimpleCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs +, -, *, / and displays the results using another function.
ScientificCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs any four scientific operation of your chioice and displays the results using another function.
Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using these 2 classes
Also, answer the questions given below.

What type of Inheritance are you using?
Which mode of Inheritance are you using?
Create an object of HybridCalculator and display results of simple and scientific calculator.
How is code reusability implemented? 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
/*
Create 2 classes:
    1. SimpleCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs +, -, *, / and displays the results using another function.
    2. ScientificCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs any four scientific operations of your choice and displays the results using another function.

    Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using these 2 classes:
    Q1. What type of Inheritance are you using?
    Q2. Which mode of Inheritance are you using?
    Q3. Create an object of HybridCalculator and display results of the simple and scientific calculator.
    Q4. How is code reusability implemented?
*/
int main(){
    
    return 0;
}
