In this tutorial, we will discuss File I/O in C++: Reading and  Writing Files

File I/O in C++: Reading and  Writing Files
These are some useful classes for working with files in C++

fstreambase
ifstream --> derived from fstreambase
ofstream --> derived from fstreambase

In order to work with files in C++, you will have to open it. Primarily, there are 2 ways to open a file:

Using the constructor
Using the member function open() of the class
An example program is shown below to demonstrate the concept of reading and  writing files

#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    string st = "Harry bhai";
    // Opening files using constructor and writing it
    ofstream out("sample60.txt"); // Write operation
    out<<st;

    return 0;
}
Code Snippet 1:  Writing Files Example Program

As shown in a code snippet 1,

We have created a string “st” which has a value “harry Bhai”
Object “out” is created of the type ofstream and the file “sample60.txt” is passed to it
The string “st” is passed to object “out”
The output of the following program is shown in figure 1


Figure 1:  Writing File Operation Output

#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    string st2;
    // Opening files using constructor and reading it
    ifstream in("sample60b.txt"); // Read operation
    in>>st2;
    getline(in, st2);  
    cout<<st2;

    return 0;
}
Code Snippet 2: Reading Files Example Program


As shown in a code snippet 1,

We have created a string “st2” which is empty
We have made a text file “sample60b.txt” and written “This is coming from a file” in it
Object “in” is created of the type instream and the file “sample60b.txt” is passed to it
The function “getline” is called and the object “in” and the string “st2” are passed to it. The main thing to note here is that the function “getline” is used when we want to read the whole line
String “st2” is printed
The output of the following program is shown in figure 2
